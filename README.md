## About The Project
This project is part of Sri Lanka Water Platform Diagnostics Analytic Work which consists of Public Expenditure Review (PER), Economy Analysis of WASH, predictive modeling for drought, integrating flood and drought risks analysis and population at risk, analysis of Comminuty-Based Organizations(CBOs), and aggregate water risk for Sri Lanka — drought, flood and water quality.

## Preview
### population exposure to flood risk at DSD level (administrative level 3)
The highest proportion of population exposure to varying levels of flood risks are concentrated in the southwestern portion of the country. 
DSD’s in the north on the other hand have less flood risk exposure overall.

### bivariate analysis - population exposure to flood and drought risk
DSDs in the southwest are more exposed to high flood risk;
DSDs in the northeast are more exposed to high drought risk
20% of DSDs both high flood and high drought risk
